## ⚙️ Local Setup & Execution

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aceest-fitness-gym.git
cd aceest-fitness-gym
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the application

```bash
python app.py
```

### 4️⃣ Open in browser

```

```

---

## 🧪 Running Tests (Pytest)

Run all tests using:

```bash
pytest
```

Tests include:

* Home route validation
* Database initialization
* Login functionality
* Error handling

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup

### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t aceest-gym .
```

### Run Container

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 aceest-gym
```

### Run Tests Inside Docker

```bash
docker run --rm aceest-gym pytest
```

---

## ⚙️ Jenkins Pipeline

The Jenkins pipeline automates the build process.

### Pipeline Stages:

1. **Checkout Code**

   * Pulls code from GitHub

2. **Build Docker Image**

   * Creates containerized environment

3. **Run Tests**

   * Executes Pytest inside Docker

### Outcome:

* Ensures code works in a clean environment
* Acts as a quality gate before deployment

---

## 🔄 GitHub Actions CI/CD

GitHub Actions automates testing on every code change.

### Trigger Conditions:

* On every `push`
* On every `pull_request`

### Workflow Steps:

1. Checkout repository
2. Setup Python environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Run Pytest
5. Build Docker image

### Result:

* Automatic validation of every change
* Prevents broken code from entering main branch
